    "causal_model_output": "Sure, let's go through each step methodically to ensure a comprehensive and accurate causal model for predicting income.\n\n### Step 0: Knowledge Graph Context\nThe provided knowledge graph outlines various relationships among the dataset variables. It includes core demographic factors, education paths, work-related paths, demographics impact, family status, financial factors, and work experience. This graph will serve as the foundation for building the causal model.\n\n### Step 1: Semantic Interpretation\nLet's provide a brief explanation of each column's meaning and possible data type:\n\n1. **Age**: The age of the individual (Numeric).\n2. **Workclass**: The type of employment sector the individual is in (Categorical).\n3. **Education_Num**: The number of years of education completed (Numeric).\n4. **Marital_Status**: The marital status of the individual (Categorical).\n5. **Occupation**: The type of job the individual holds (Categorical).\n6. **Relationship**: The individual's relationship status within a household (Categorical).\n7. **Race**: The race of the individual (Categorical).\n8. **Sex**: The gender of the individual (Categorical).\n9. **Capital_Gain**: Income from investment sources other than salary/wages (Numeric).\n10. **Capital_Loss**: Losses from investment sources other than salary/wages (Numeric).\n11. **Hours_per_week**: Number of hours the individual works per week (Numeric).\n12. **Country**: The country of residence (Categorical).\n13. **Income**: The income level of the individual, typically a binary indicator of whether income is above or below a certain threshold (Categorical).\n\n### Step 2: Causal Modeling Objective\nThe goal is to predict **Income** using the provided dataset.\n\n### Step 3: Causal Pathway Analysis and Relationship Expansion\nWe will analyze the provided knowledge graph and identify potential causal pathways to predict **Income**.\n\n#### Direct Effects on Income:\n1. **Education_Num \u2192 Income**: Higher

These levels indicate direct and indirect causal effects on the target variable, Income. The graph helps inform potential causal structures and ensures consistency in semantic interpretation and causal reasoning.\n\n### Step 1: Semantic Interpretation\n\n- **Age**: The age of the individual (Numerical).\n- **Workclass**: The type of employer (Categorical).\n- **Education_Num**: The number of years of education (Numerical).\n- **Marital_Status**: The marital status of the individual (Categorical).\n- **Occupation**: The type of job (Categorical).\n- **Relationship**: The individual's relationship status (e.g., spouse, child) (Categorical).\n- **Race**: The race of the individual (Categorical).\n- **Sex**: The gender of the individual (Categorical).\n- **Capital_Gain**: Income from capital gains (Numerical).\n- **Capital_Loss**: Losses from capital investments (Numerical).\n- **Hours_per_week**: Number of hours worked per week (Numerical).\n- **Country**: The country of residence (Categorical).\n- **Income**: The income level (Categorical: e.g., >50K, <=50K).\n\n### Step 2: Causal Modeling Objective\n\nThe goal is to predict **Income** based on the provided dataset.\n\n### Step 3: Causal Pathway Analysis and Relationship Expansion\n\n#### Direct Causal Effects on Income\n- **Education_Num \u2192 Income**: Higher education levels typically lead to higher income.\n- **Occupation \u2192 Income**: Different occupations have varying income levels.\n- **Hours_per_week \u2192 Income**: More hours worked generally correlates with higher income.\n- **Capital_Gain \u2192 Income**: Directly increases income.\n- **Capital_Loss \u2192 Income**: Directly decreases income.\n\n#### Indirect Causal Effects on Income\n- **Age \u2192 Education_Num \u2192 Income**: Older individuals may have more years of education, affecting income.\n- **Country \u2192 Education_Num \u2192 Income**: Different countries have different educational systems and opportunities.\n- **Sex \u2192 Occupation \u2192 Income**: Gender can influence the type of occupation, which in turn affects income.\n- **Education_Num \u2192 Occupation \u2192 Income**: Higher education can lead to better-paying occupations.\n- **Race \u2192 Occupation \u2192 Income**: Race can influence the type of occupation, affecting income.\n\n#### Additional Relationships\n- **Country \u2192 Race**: The racial composition varies by country.\n- **Age \u2192 Marital_Status**: Age can influence marital status.\n- **Sex \u2192 Marital_Status**: Gender can influence marital status.\n- **Marital_Status \u2192 Relationship**: Marital status determines relationship status.\n- **Relationship \u2192 Hours_per_week**: Relationship status can influence the number of hours worked.\n- **Country \u2192 Workclass**: Different countries have different workclass distributions.\n- **Workclass \u2192 Occupation**: The type of employer can influence the type of job.\n- **Country \u2192 Capital_Gain**: Different countries have different capital gain opportunities.\n- **Education_Num \u2192 Capital_Gain**: Higher education can lead to better investment opportunities.\n- **Country \u2192 Capital_Loss**: Different countries have different capital loss opportunities.\n- **Education_Num \u2192 Capital_Loss**: Higher education can lead to better management of investments.\n\n### Step 4: DAG Construction\n\n```dot\ndigraph G {\n    // Nodes\n    Age;\n    Workclass;\n    Education_Num;\n    Marital_Status;\n    Occupation;\n    Relationship;\n    Race;\n    Sex;\n    Capital_Gain;\n    Capital_Loss;\n    Hours_per_week;\n    Country;\n    Income;\n\n    // Level 1 -
